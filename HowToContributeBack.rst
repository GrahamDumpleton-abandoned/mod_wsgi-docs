How to contribute back
======================

Who Are The Developers
----------------------

The mod_wsgi package is a solo effort by
[http://blog.dscpl.com.au Graham Dumpleton].

The package is developed purely in the author's spare time and is not
funded in any way by a company, nor is it developed for a specific
companies requirements. In fact the author doesn't even develop it for his
own needs. It is developed purely because it represents an interesting
technical challenge and not because the author needs it himself to host a
web site.

How To Make A Donation
----------------------

Donations can be made via
[https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=636842 PayPal]
or by selecting items from the author's Amazon
[http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1ENAXIJG1G044/ref=wl_web/ wish list].

A suggested formula for how much to donate is:

  * If using mod_wsgi for personal use, then consider donating what you would pay for one month worth of web hosting services for your own site.

  * If using mod_wsgi for a company web site, then consider donating what you would pay for two months worth of web hosting services for that site.

  * If using mod_wsgi as part of a web hosting service which you then charge other people for using, then consider donating what you would charge a customer for three months worth of web hosting services.

In other words, be somewhat reasonable, and donate an amount commensurate
with how much benefit you are getting from mod_wsgi. On that basis,
donations might realistically range from $10 up to $500 or more. Obviously
where your company spends ridiculous amounts of money on web hosting you
can instead elect to donate something more within the range stated above
rather than how much you actually spend on web hosting services.

How Are Donations Used
----------------------

Any monetary donations typically go towards buying clothes, toys, music,
books and apps for the authors 3 year old daughter. Money has also been
used in the past to pay for attending conferences and to buy computer
hardware.

How Else Can You Donate
-----------------------

By prior arrangement, the author is also happy to accept free access to VPS
or cloud hosting services for testing and experimentation. In practice
though the author doesn't always have much spare time to make use of these,
so check first what may actually be of use.

If you are an author of a book related to Apache, Python or web hosting in
general, then will also happily accept an electronic copy of it for
reference.

Hardware can also be donated and at the moment the author is keen to get an
Apple Mac Mini or two, plus wireless keyboards and mice to go with them.
These would be used as a home entertainment system and software build
server.

At the minimum, at least consider helping to push up the author's kudos
ranking on
[http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/5497/kudos Ohloh] by giving kudos or adding
mod_wsgi to your Ohloh project stack.

What Do You Get In Return
-------------------------

At the moment nothing extra can be offered in recognition of making a
donation except the ability to ask questions related to a companies
internal use, where confidential information is involved, via private email
rather than in public on the mailing list.

In the future, exclusive or priority access may be provided to better
quality documentation. This will depend though on time being available to
write such documentation.
