Download The Software
=====================

.. Nothing In Life Is Free
.. -----------------------
.. 
.. A significant amount of time and effort has gone into producing this
.. software, the documentation and in providing support to users. So, although
.. you are free to download it and do with it as you wish, it is not free from
.. cost.
.. 
.. If you are using mod_wsgi, please consider making a
.. that mod_wsgi will continue to be developed and the documentation further
.. improved.
.. 
.. If you are philosophically against the idea of contributing back to Open
.. Source projects in a monetary way and find it obnoxious that any Open
.. Source project would solicit donations, then it is suggested that you use
.. one of the alternatives to mod_wsgi such as
.. `CGI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface>`_.

Source Code Downloads
---------------------

The most up to date and recommended version of mod_wsgi is 3.3.

* `mod_wsgi-3.3.tar.gz - Source Code
  <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/detail?name=mod_wsgi-3.3.tar.gz>`_

For a list of changes made in this version see:

* :doc:`package-release-notes/version-3.3`

For a list of changes in all versions of mod_wsgi see:

* :doc:`package-release-notes/index`

For details on how to install from the source code see:

* :doc:`installation-guides/building-from-source-code`

Windows Binary Downloads
------------------------

Variations of precompiled binaries currently available for Windows are as
follows. You need to make sure you select the correct one for the version
of Python and Apache that is being used:

* `mod_wsgi-win32-ap22py26-3.3.so - Apache 2.2 / Python 2.6
  <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/detail?name=mod_wsgi-win32-ap22py26-3.3.so>`_
* `mod_wsgi-win32-ap22py27-3.3.so - Apache 2.2 / Python 2.7
  <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/detail?name=mod_wsgi-win32-ap22py27-3.3.so>`_

For details on how to install these files see:

* :doc:`installation-guides/installation-on-windows`

Note that these binaries will only work for 32 bit Python and 32 bit Apache.
If you need to use 64 bit Python and 64 bit Apache and can't compile mod_wsgi
yourself from source code, you may look at the Windows binaries available
for `ActivateState Python <http://code.activestate.com/pypm/modwsgi-apache2.2/>`_.
It is presumed that you have to be using ActivateState Python installation
for them to work. It is not known where you would however get 64 bit Apache
from as believe ASF only provides a 32 bit installer.

MacOS X Binary Downloads
------------------------

A precompiled binary is currently supplied for MacOS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).
This is specifically for the Apple supplied Apache 2.2.X and Python 2.6.X
and should not be used with MacPort or fink Apache/Python packages, or self
compiled Apache/Python packages.

* `mod_wsgi-macosx106-ap22py26-3.3.so - Apache 2.2 / Python 2.6
  <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/detail?name=mod_wsgi-macosx106-ap22py26-3.3.so>`_
